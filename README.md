OSGFM - Old School Graphics Framework for Metal
===============================================

OSGFM is intended to support simple programs that are primarily concerned with rendering interactive graphics with Apple's Metal API. Its design resembles similar libraries of the past, such as [GLUT](https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/), & is therefore 'old school' in spirit.

The public API of OSGFM is written in C++, though it exposes a functional interface that accepts closures.
